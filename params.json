{"name":"Jquery.appear","tagline":"jQuery plugin for tracking element's appearance in browser viewport (Page, Frame or IFrame)","body":"# jQuery.appear\r\n\r\nThis plugin adds the *appear* and *disappear* events to jquery: these events will fire when any given element becomes visible/invisible in the browser viewport, allowing you to:\r\n\r\n- automatically or programmatically show/hide any HTML content as soon as it comes inside or outside the browser viewport (i.e. when the user scrolls to them).\r\n- prevent unnecessary processing for content that is hidden or is outside of the browser viewport.\r\n- trigger a custom function or behaviour (such as loading external AJAX content) when a certain point of the page is reached.\r\n\r\nand more.\r\n\r\nThe plugin also supports *frame*, *iframe* and/or *dynamically-generated* content.\r\n\r\nRequires jQuery 1.7 or above.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Home Page\r\n\r\nFor the latest package, documentation, API and support please refer to the project <a href=\"http://darkseal.github.io/jquery.appear/\">Home Page</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n        $('selector').appear(); \r\n        // It supports optional hash with \"forceProcess\" and \"interval\" keys. \r\n        // Check source code for details.\r\n\r\n        $('<div>content</div>').appear(); \r\n        // It also supports raw DOM nodes wrapped in jQuery.\r\n\r\n        $('selector').on('appear', function(event, $all_elements) {\r\n          // triggers when 'selector' element is inside browser viewport.\r\n          // $all_elements contains all the appeared elements.\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n        $('yourselector').on('disappear', function(event, $all_elements) {\r\n          // triggers when 'selector' element is outside browser viewport.\r\n          // $all_elements contains all the disappeared elements.\r\n        });\r\n\r\nIf you want to fire *appear* event for elements which are close to viewport but are not visible yet you may either:\r\n- use the offsetTop and offsetLeft *options* properties during initialization.\r\n- add the following custom data attributes *offset-top* and *offset-left* to DOM nodes.\r\n\r\n        $('#myEl').appear({ offsetTop: 100 }); \r\n        // appear will be fired when \"myEl\" is 100 or less pixels\r\n        // below browser viewport \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n        <div id=\"myEl\" data-offset-top=\"100\">...</div>\r\n        // same as above using data attributes.\r\n\r\nAppear check can also be forced by calling *$.forceAppear()*. This is suitable in cases when page is in initial state (not scrolled and not resized) and when you want manually trigger appearance check.\r\n\r\nThere's also a custom jQuery filter you can use for manual checking element appearance.\r\n\r\n        $('selector').is(':appeared')\r\n\r\n\r\n# Demo and Examples\r\n\r\nCheck the project <a href=\"http://darkseal.github.io/jquery.appear/demo.html\">demo page</a> to see the most common implementation scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\nThis is a revamp/upgrade of two jquery.appear plugins respectively hosted on:\r\n- http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/\r\n- https://github.com/morr/jquery.appear\r\n\r\nThe original plugins have been partially rewritten and updated in order to support additional features, namely:\r\n- IFrame support\r\n- more options\r\n- configurable values\r\n- revised documentation\r\n- additional samples\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n> Licensed under <a href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\">MIT license</a>.\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\n> obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\n> files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\n> restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\n> copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\n> Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\n> conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n> included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\n> OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n> NONINFRINGEMENT.
