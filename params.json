{"name":"Jquery.appear","tagline":"jQuery plugin for tracking element's appearance in browser viewport (Page, Frame or IFrame)","body":"# jQuery.scrolling\r\n\r\nThis plugin adds the *scrollin* and *scrollout* events to jquery: these events will fire when any given element becomes visible/invisible in the browser viewport, allowing you to:\r\n\r\n- automatically or programmatically show/hide any HTML content as soon as it comes inside or outside the browser viewport (i.e. when the user scrolls to them).\r\n- prevent unnecessary processing for content that is hidden or is outside of the browser viewport.\r\n- trigger a custom function or behaviour (such as loading external AJAX content) when a certain point of the page is reached.\r\n\r\nand more.\r\n\r\nThe plugin also supports *frame*, *iframe* and/or *dynamically-generated* content.\r\n\r\nRequires jQuery 1.7 or above.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Home Page\r\n\r\nFor the latest package, documentation, API and support please refer to the project <a href=\"http://darkseal.github.io/jquery.scrolling/\">Home Page</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nInstalling the plugin is easy: all you need to do is download the latest version from the official project page (<a href=\"https://github.com/Darkseal/jquery.scrolling/tarball/master\">tar</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkseal/jquery.scrolling/zipball/master\">zip</a>): unpack the archive somewhere, copy the .js file in your website javascript folder and add the following line to the *head* block of your web page:\r\n\r\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/yourpath/jquery.scrolling.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nActivate the plugin for one or more elements defined by a selector:\r\n\r\n        $('selector').scrolling(); \r\n\r\nOr for raw DOM nodes created using the standard jQuery syntax:\r\n\r\n        $('<div>content</div>').scrolling(); \r\n        \r\nOnce activated, you can bind your code to the *scrollin* and *scrollout* events: they will trigger when the active element(s) will come inside the browser viewport.\r\n\r\n        $('selector').on('scrollin', function(event, $all_elements) {\r\n          // we reach this point as soon as the 'selector' element becomes visibile inside the browser viewport.\r\n          // $all_elements contains all the appeared elements.\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n        $('yourselector').on('scrollout', function(event, $all_elements) {\r\n          // we reach this point as soon as the 'selector' element goes outside the browser viewport.\r\n          // $all_elements contains all the disappeared elements.\r\n        });\r\n\r\nIf you want to fire the *scrollIn* event for elements which are close to viewport but are not visible yet you may either:\r\n- use the offsetTop and offsetLeft *options* properties during initialization.\r\n- add the following custom data attributes *offset-top* and *offset-left* to DOM nodes.\r\n\r\n        $('#myEl').scrolling({ offsetTop: 100 }); \r\n        // appear will be fired when \"myEl\" is 100 or less pixels\r\n        // below browser viewport \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n        <div id=\"myEl\" data-offset-top=\"100\">...</div>\r\n        // same as above using data attributes.\r\n\r\nAppear check can also be forced by calling *$.checkScrolling()*. This is suitable in cases when page is in initial state (not scrolled and not resized) and when you want manually trigger appearance check.\r\n\r\nThere's also a custom *scrollin* jQuery filter you can use for manual checking if the element is inside the viewport or not.\r\n\r\n        $('selector').is(':scrollin')\r\n\r\n\r\n# Demo and Examples\r\n\r\nCheck the project <a href=\"http://darkseal.github.io/jquery.scrolling/demo.html\">demo page</a> to see the most common implementation scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Related links\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"http://darkseal.github.io/jquery.scrolling/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Home Page</a>, where you can dowload the latest version.\r\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkseal/jquery.scrolling\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>, where you can review the source code and/or fork it to your needs.\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery.scrolling\" target=\"_blank\">jquery.scrolling official page</a> on NPM.org, the node.js repository of most jQuery plugins.\r\n- <a href=\"http://www.ryadel.com/works/jquery-scrolling/\" target=\"_blank\">jquery.scrolling project page</a> on the author website.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\nThis is a revamp/upgrade of the jquery.appear plugins respectively hosted on:\r\n- http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/\r\n- https://github.com/morr/jquery.appear\r\n\r\nThe original code has been rewritten and updated in order to support additional features, namely:\r\n- IFrame support\r\n- more options\r\n- configurable values\r\n- revised documentation\r\n- additional samples\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nYou can support this project's development by clicking on the following button.\r\n  \r\n[<img src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Donate\">](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VCYVYT76A3QEJ)\r\n  \r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n> Licensed under <a href=\"http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\">MIT license</a>.\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\n> obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\n> files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\n> restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\n> copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\n> Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\n> conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n> included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\n> OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n> NONINFRINGEMENT.
